# Introduction
For my senior capstone project I will be combining Nvidia's neural network with a Traxxas Slash 4x4 remote control car to implement a scaled self driving car. The performance of the convolutional neural network will be assesed the ability of the remote control car to autonomously navigate a simulated one-lane road circuit. Through this combination I can test methods to improve on the already existing model. Possible paths include implementing new developments in the field of neural networks such as a recurrent neural network, or changing parameters with how the image is fed into this neural network.

The goal of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network which will be able to navigate a scaled self driving car on a circuit with no human intervention.
